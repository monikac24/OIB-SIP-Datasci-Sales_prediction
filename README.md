### Dataset:
[dataset_link](https://github.com/monikac24/OIB-SIP-Datasci-Sales_prediction/blob/main/Advertising.csv)

### Objective : 
The objective of this analysis is to determine how different advertising mediums (TV, Radio, Newspaper) affect sales. The goal is to build a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on TV advertising spend.

### Key Activities :
1) Data Loading and Exploration:
Loaded the advertising dataset.
Explored the dataset by checking its shape and summary statistics.
Visualized relationships between features (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and the target variable (Sales).

2) Data Visualization:
Plotted scatter plots to see the relationship between each advertising medium and sales.
Plotted histograms to understand the distribution of the advertising mediums.
Used a heatmap to show correlations between the features and the target variable.

3) Data Splitting:
Split the data into training and testing sets.

4) Model Building:
Built a linear regression model using TV as the predictor.
Fitted the model on the training data.
Made predictions on the test data.

5) Model Evaluation:
Evaluated the model's coefficients and intercept.
Visualized the regression line against the test data

### Technologies Used:
a)Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

b)Techniques: Linear Regression, Data Visualization

### Key Insights :
The scatter plots and histograms provide an initial understanding of the data distribution and relationships.
The heatmap shows that TV advertising has the highest correlation with sales compared to radio and newspaper.
The linear regression model provides a simple way to predict sales based on TV advertising spend.

### Conclusion :
The analysis successfully demonstrates how TV advertising spend influences sales. The linear regression model is a straightforward yet effective tool for making these predictions. Further analysis can include multiple linear regression using all advertising mediums or exploring more advanced models to improve predictions.
